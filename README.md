# DEPENDABLE-ROBOTS
DEPENDABLE-ROBOTS is a code repository for DTU course Building dependable robot systems - 31386. 
The aim of the project is to develop and implement algorithms on the custom made Robobot which 
can compete at DTU Robocup.

These four files are the ones needed to run custom made missions. Instructions and the whole firmware can be found at DTU's corresponding
[webpage](http://rsewiki.elektro.dtu.dk/index.php/Robobot).

The competition was postponed this year because of the corona situation, therefore the missions were simplified and carried out at home.
